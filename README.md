====================

Code needed for building the data and learner for predicting chiptunes using
MIDI representations

Files
-----

    data/
        training/*.mid
            - Midi files used for training the algorithm.  Comprises 2/3rds of
              the midi's we've gathered
        testing/*.mid
            - Midi files used for testing the algorithm.  Comprises 1/3rd of the
              midi's we've gathered
        training_counts.data
            - A serialized set of counts for observations in the training data.
              The file is a pickel'd python dict, with two sub-structures, one a
              list files that have been processed so far, and the other a dict
              of counts, with 1 through 32-wise observations


Installing
----------

Just install python-midi by running:

 1.  `cd contrib/python-midi`
 2.  `python setup.py install`
